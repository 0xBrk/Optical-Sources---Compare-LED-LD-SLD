ABSTRACT 
The performance and efficiency of optical communication systems are directly dependent on the characteristics of the light source used and the requirements of the application environment. 
In this study, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), Laser Diodes (LDs) and Super Luminescent Diodes (SLDs), which are the cornerstones of optical source technologies, were examined comparatively in terms of their 
emission mechanisms, spectral bandwidth, modulation speed and output power. 

Within the scope of the study, a realistic link design was conceptualised based on a fibre optic communication scenario. Detailed link budget calculations were performed for the selected 
scenario; critical parameters such as path loss, scattering, and receiver sensitivity were analysed. In light of the numerical data obtained and theoretical comparisons, the most optimal 
optical source for the targeted system was determined. The report justifies the engineering suitability of the selected source in terms of reliability, cost and performance balance. 

Keywords: Optical Sources, LED, Laser Diode, Link Budget, Optical Communication Design.
